### Project Overview
----------------------------------
Students often feel a huge gap between what is being taught in college and what they have to do in the real world.Is there a solution to bridge the gap without them taking help of extra courses online.

### Solution Description
----------------------------------

to minimize the gap between learning and application without the burden of any online courses. delivering ready to go and real time practice sessions to the user which are used in the industries to let them apply their knowledge to real life problems faced in the industries and companies. organizing webinars to deliver the application of work by industrial professionals and developers in it firms 
All the professionals of a particular branch or stream can stay connected throughout the app and share their  personal experiences about their work in their respective companies. for example the user is a software developer having the programming skills in language c,c++ and javascript then he gets placed in oracle and is put in a team for the development of company's portal which requires the basic knowledge of the language used by the company professionals, so the user can be benefited by this app by knowing the professionals work and their experiences in developing the real time applications and can apply the knowledge to it without the burden of any online course in a nutshell an app which makes you industry ready by giving a shape to your inbuilt potential but of course you cant do anything without any prior knowledge,  if you are a college graduate we assume that you have the basic needed knowledge of your respective fields
The interface can be made similar to linkedin and upgrad. but instead of searching jobs and completing your course, you are interacting with the industry professionals in a network and some extracted videos and video conferences can be arranged to give you ready to go instructions, but the main part of all this is that the user must have basic skills and the endurance to work. Impact-less mistakes, skilled employees, more employment, smooth work,time efficient,money efficient as people spend a lot of money to buy online courses whereas this app provides you the service at much lower price,people having real time knowledge of their respective field and can be employed in various services contributing to the economy,by interacting with the professionals the users can also develop ideas for
the startups.
